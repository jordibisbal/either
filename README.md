# Why

Optional (inspired by the functional thing), helps to:
* Better handling of exception (JustSuccess/Failure).
* Better typed alternative to the use of null (None/Some).
* Simplify the control flow on errors.
* Build failsafe code
* Improve testability.

## Optional

Is a pragmatic version on the Optional/Either/Maybe from functional programing, it provides functionality
present in such languages along some extra to solve some common use cases in php.
