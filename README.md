# Why

Either (inspired by the functional thing), helps to:
* Get rid of exceptions (Success/Failure).
* Discourage the use of null (None/Some).
* Simplify the control flow on errors.
* Build failsafe code
* Improve testability.

## Either

Is a supercharged version on the Maybe/Either from functional programing, it provides functionality
present in such languages along some extra to solve some common use cases in php.
